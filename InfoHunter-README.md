## Changelog

### v1.17 — Current
- **Fixed**: Horizontal scrolling — Termux translates horizontal finger swipes into rapid `MouseDown/Up` tap pairs (not scroll events), so touch-based horizontal scrolling is not possible; instead made arrow key scrolling much faster: `←`/`→` jump 8 columns per press, `Shift+←`/`Shift+→` jump 40 columns, `Home`/`End` snap to the far left/right edge
- **Removed**: Dead `on_mouse_scroll_left`/`on_mouse_scroll_right` handlers (confirmed non-functional on Termux/Android)

### v1.16
- **Added**: Horizontal scrolling in Termux — finger swipes left/right now scroll the headline table horizontally via `on_mouse_scroll_left`/`on_mouse_scroll_right` handlers; `←` / `→` arrow keys also scroll horizontally; horizontal scrollbar enabled on the DataTable

### v1.15
- **Fixed**: Scroll position resetting after the user scrolls between refreshes — replaced snapshot-based restore with continuous tracking via `on_scroll_changed`; `_user_scroll_y` is updated every time the user moves the viewport (mouse wheel, scrollbar, keyboard), so the restore always uses the latest position rather than a stale pre-rebuild snapshot

### v1.14
- **Fixed**: Scroll position not preserved on refresh when using mouse wheel or scrollbar — `move_cursor` was triggering an auto-scroll-into-view that overrode the restored position; now uses `call_after_refresh` + `set_scroll` to restore the exact scroll offset after the layout pass settles

### v1.13
- **Fixed**: Scroll position jumping to top on every feed refresh — cursor row and scroll offset are now saved before the table is cleared and restored after it's rebuilt

### v1.12
- **Fixed**: `ScreenStackError` crash from accidental command palette activation on mobile — disabled with `COMMANDS = set()` and `ENABLE_COMMAND_PALETTE = False`
- **Simplified**: Startup is instant, no external dependencies

### v1.4
- Fixed search freeze/deadlock using `push_screen(callback=...)` pattern

### v1.3
- Fixed search crash (`NoActiveWorker`) with `@work(thread=True)`

### v1.2
- Fixed detail view crash on URLs with special characters
- Fixed geopolitical scoring (Houthi, Red Sea, pipeline, OPEC)
- Lowered refresh rate to 15s

### v1.1
- Fixed NFP, GDP, Fed rate, and stablecoin depeg scoring patterns

### v1.0
- Initial release: 26 RSS sources, rule-based scoring, Textual UI
